# DEVELOPMENT

A practical overview of the development workflow, code structure, and debugging tools.

## 1. Setup

First, clone the repository and run the setup script. This will install the correct version of the Zig toolchain into a local `./zig/` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kausaldb/kausaldb
cd kausaldb
./scripts/install_zig.sh
```

The project includes Git hooks that automate formatting and testing before each commit.

## 2. Workflow

The build system (`build.zig`) provides several targets to support a fast and reliable development cycle.

*   **Run fast tests (dev loop):**
    This is your main command during development. It runs all unit tests and fast integration tests.
    ```bash
    ./zig/zig build test
    ```

*   **Format code:**
    We use `zig fmt` to maintain a consistent code style.
    ```bash
    ./zig/zig build fmt
    ```

*   **Check for style violations:**
    The `tidy` checker enforces project-specific naming and style conventions.
    ```bash
    ./zig/zig build tidy
    ```

*   **Run the full validation suite (before PR):**
    This command runs the complete test suite, including longer scenario and E2E tests.
    ```bash
    ./zig/zig build test-all
    ```

## 4. Code Structure

The source code is organized by functionality in the `src/` directory:

*   `src/core/`: Fundamental data structures (`types.zig`), memory management (`memory.zig`, `arena.zig`), and the VFS abstraction (`vfs.zig`).
*   `src/storage/`: The LSM-Tree implementation, including the WAL (`wal/`), memtable (`block_index.zig`), SSTables (`sstable.zig`), and compaction logic.
*   `src/query/`: The query engine, graph traversal algorithms, and caching.
*   `src/cli/`: The command-line interface, including the parser, client, and renderer.
*   `src/server/`: The TCP server daemon and connection manager.
*   `src/testing/`: The core simulation framework, including the test harness, workload generator, and property checkers.
*   `src/sim/`: The deterministic simulation components, including the `SimulationVFS`.
