# Query Engine Architecture Evolution

## Overview

CortexDB's QueryEngine implements a sophisticated planning and optimization framework designed for extensibility and performance. This document outlines the current architecture and evolution plan for advanced query capabilities.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Query Planning Framework (`QueryPlan`)

```zig
pub const QueryPlan = struct {
    query_type: QueryType,
    estimated_cost: u64,
    estimated_result_count: u32,
    optimization_hints: OptimizationHints,
    cache_eligible: bool,
    execution_strategy: ExecutionStrategy,
};
```

**Purpose**: Cost-based query optimization with adaptive strategies
**Key Features**:
- Multi-tier optimization based on complexity analysis
- Workload-adaptive hint generation
- Execution strategy selection (direct_storage, cached_result, index_lookup, hybrid_approach, streaming_scan, optimized_traversal)
- Cache eligibility determination

#### 2. Query Execution Context (`QueryContext`)

```zig
pub const QueryContext = struct {
    query_id: u64,
    start_time_ns: i64,
    plan: QueryPlan,
    metrics: QueryMetrics,
    cache_key: ?[]const u8,
};
```

**Purpose**: Per-query execution tracking and metrics collection
**Key Features**:
- Unique query ID generation for tracing
- Comprehensive metrics collection (blocks_scanned, edges_traversed, cache_hits, optimization effectiveness)
- Performance measurement infrastructure

#### 3. Query Statistics (`QueryStatistics`)

**Purpose**: Aggregate performance analytics and optimization feedback
**Key Metrics**:
- Query type distribution (find_blocks, traversal, semantic, filtered)
- Average latency and queries-per-second calculations
- Total execution time tracking
- Thread-safe atomic counters

### Optimization Strategies

#### Complexity-Based Optimization

```zig
pub fn analyze_complexity(self: *QueryPlan, block_count: u32, edge_count: u32) void {
    const complexity_factor = block_count + (edge_count / 2);
    if (complexity_factor > 10000) {
        // High complexity: index + prefetch + hybrid execution
        self.optimization_hints.use_index = true;
        self.optimization_hints.enable_prefetch = true;
        self.execution_strategy = .hybrid_approach;
    } else if (complexity_factor > 1000) {
        // Medium complexity: index + caching + specialized traversal
        self.optimization_hints.use_index = true;
        self.cache_eligible = true;
        if (self.query_type == .traversal) {
            self.execution_strategy = .optimized_traversal;
        }
    } else {
        // Low complexity: direct memtable access
        self.optimization_hints.prefer_memtable = true;
        self.execution_strategy = .direct_storage;
    }
}
```

#### Workload-Adaptive Optimizations

- **Find Blocks**: Early termination for large queries, memtable preference for recent data
- **Traversal**: Result limits, prefetching for complex graphs, optimized algorithms
- **Semantic/Filtered**: Index usage for large queries, streaming for massive result sets

### Caching Integration Points

#### Cache Eligibility Determination
```zig
fn should_cache_query(query_type: QueryPlan.QueryType) bool {
    return switch (query_type) {
        .semantic, .filtered => true, // Complex queries benefit from caching
        .traversal => true,           // Graph traversals often repeat
        .find_blocks => false,        // Simple lookups rarely repeat exactly
    };
}
```

#### Cache Infrastructure
- Cache key generation (prepared but not implemented)
- Hit rate tracking for adaptive caching strategies
- Cost-based cache eligibility (queries > 5000 cost units)

## Query Types and Execution Paths

### 1. Find Blocks Query
- **Purpose**: Retrieve blocks by ID with batch optimization
- **Optimizations**: Memtable preference, early termination, batch sizing
- **Metrics**: Blocks scanned, cache effectiveness

### 2. Traversal Query
- **Purpose**: Graph traversal with depth limits and directional control
- **Optimizations**: Specialized algorithms, prefetching, result limits
- **Metrics**: Edges traversed, traversal efficiency

### 3. Semantic Query
- **Purpose**: Content-based similarity search (future ML integration)
- **Optimizations**: Index lookup, streaming scan for large results
- **Metrics**: Index effectiveness, content matching accuracy

### 4. Filtered Query
- **Purpose**: Complex conditional filtering with expressions
- **Optimizations**: Index-based filtering, streaming for large datasets
- **Metrics**: Filter selectivity, index utilization
